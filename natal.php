Natal Chart Report</H1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Introduction to Your Birth Chart Report</h4>
<p>What follows is your personal natal chart information, as well as interpretations of the positions and aspects in your chart.</p>
<p>With this report, you'll find out the positions of the planets in your
natal chart by sign. The most personal of these are the Sun sign, Moon sign,
Mercury sign, Venus sign, and Mars sign. Most people already know their Sun
sign.
<p>If your time of birth is known, you will also find out your Ascendant, or
rising sign, as well as the positions of the planets in the houses of your
chart. Additionally, aspects between the planets are listed and interpreted.</p>
<p>If the birth time is unknown, we cannot know the Ascendant or house positions. The natal chart shown here is an Aries chart in that case. Additionally, you may not know the Moon sign for certain. This is because the Moon changes signs approximately every 2-1/2 days. Less probable but still possible is a change of signs for the other planets and luminaries, depending on the planet itself (for example, the Sun changes signs every 30 days or so).</p><p>Each paragraph of interpretation refers to an individual position in your
chart. All of these positions and aspects are some of the &quot;parts&quot; that make up a
&quot;whole&quot;--you! Some of these interpretations will be contradictory, just as
people are contradictory. A person can be timid in love and aggressive in business, for example. As well, we evolve and grow
throughout our lives, facing challenges that help us to handle our positions and
aspects in a different way. We all have choices, and one of the major benefits
of astrology is the chance to understand ourselves so that we can work
with our natal charts and improve ourselves. Any computerized report that
interprets the individual placements in a natal chart is somewhat disjointed,
simply because the different parts that make up the whole are not synthesized.</p>
<p>Some of the interpretations are more detailed than others. You can use this as a starting point and do some further reading about different positions (such as Moon in
Libra, Saturn in the 10th house, Moon conjunct Mercury) in your chart by
exploring our own site, other astrology sites, and by reading astrology books.</p>
<p>The tables show the technical details of your natal chart, personalized
based on your birth data. Below the tables, you'll find your free birth chart interpretive report, and a chart wheel appears at the end of the report.</p>

<p><h4>Planet Positions, Ascendant, & Houses</h4>
<p>The following table shows the position of the planets in your chart, by sign and
degree. You will also find the sign of your Ascendant and the signs on
the cusp of each house in your natal chart only if the birth time is known. The Roman Numerals refer to the
houses, where the Ascendant is also the first house and the Midheaven is also
the tenth house. For example, if the sign Taurus is next to Mars, you know your
Mars is in Taurus. If the sign Libra is next to Venus, you know your Venus is in
Libra. If Cancer is next to Ascendant, you have a Cancer Ascendant, and if Leo
is next to II, Leo is on your 2nd house.</p>

<p><h4>Aspects</h4>
<p>The following table shows the planetary aspects in your natal chart. Interpretations of these factors are found below. The numbers listed under the column "Value" serve as a relative rating system for each aspect and are determined based on the planets involved, the aspect type, and the orb of influence. Negative values suggest more stressful or challenging influences while positive numbers show more flowing, easy energy. <p>This is a wide table that may require you to scroll right on smaller screens.</p> <p>See also your full natal chart wheel graphic depicted below the report.</p>

<p><h4>Natal Chart Report</h4>
<h2>Birth Chart</h2>This birth chart report shows the positions of the planets for יניב אמון.<br><br><h3>The Sun</h3>The Sun represents vitality, a sense of individuality, and outward-shining creative energy.<br><br><h5>The Sun is in Capricorn</h5>Capricorn is a feet-on-the-ground, eye-on-the-prize sign. Those with Sun in Capricorn have a realistic, grounded approach to life that is apparent no matter how dreamy the rest of the birth chart suggests they can be. These people know how to do things--and to get things done. <br><br>Some Capricorns naturally turn their backs on what they deem too frivolous. They are very much concerned with what's worthwhile--Capricorns want to do and be something worthwhile. Like their Earth signs relatives, Taurus and Virgo, they need to feel useful and effective in the real world to be satisfied with their lives. But the Capricorn spin on the earth signs is that Capricorn possesses a stronger need for recognition in a worldly sense. They have a strong sense of society and its framework, and they feel most secure when they feel they're doing their part within that framework. <br><br>Capricorns like to pare things down, and they take pleasure in the simple things in life. However, many are attracted to status symbols, and these ones will wear the best clothes (tasteful ones!) and drive quietly impressive cars. Comparing Capricorns to their symbol, the goat, brings up some interesting analogies. Solar Capricorns can see into the future and plan for it. They don't mind taking things slowly, but they absolutely aim to get to the top of the mountain in life! They make their way steadily and sure-footedly, and their strength and singleness of purpose are admirable. <br><br>Capricorns can sometimes be lonely, although they rarely let it show. They are often a little reserved--even standoffish. This is generally because they value all things practical, and they'll seldom wear their emotions on their sleeves unless they have a particularly flamboyant Moon sign. This is a sign that is surely the most resourceful of the zodiac. To some, Capricorns come across as unimaginative, but they can be enormously creative when it comes to the material world. They are generally very capable people with a strong sense of tradition and responsibility. <br><br>Many Capricorns have mastered the art of making people laugh. Their sense of humor can be of the deadpan variety--they're generally excellent at keeping a straight face. They can be bitingly sarcastic, too. Capricorns are not known for taking too many risks in life. They value the beaten track and things "tried and true." This is not to say they are stick-in-the-muds -- they simply value the hard work laid down by those who've been around before them. <br><br>Turn to your Capricorn friends for help when you need to really get things done. They'll have practical advice, and they'll help you organize and manage your life a little better. Capricorns are generally good with their "word," dependable, and rather loyal people.<br><br>Short description: <br><br>He is honest, reserved, circumspect, honorable, and strong-willed. Quietly ambitious within the realms of the possible, he likes and takes on responsibility. He can work in the social domain.<br><br>Possible issues: a sometimes bitter and mistrustful mind.<br><br> 113 Sextile between the Sun and Moon<br><br>Your emotions and your will are at peace with one another, suggesting a rather balanced personality. The "messages" you received in childhood were not contradictory overall, and you have a stronger sense of purpose and appreciation of harmony than most people. <br><br>You are likely personally popular, mainly because you expect harmony in your relationships. You are attractive to most people, and your self-confidence and security make you easy to deal with on many levels. <br><br>Your relaxed, easygoing disposition puts others at ease. Your "default setting" can be unprepared for conflict, and you often avoid "rocking the boat." You may acquiesce to others a little too often, if only to maintain balance and harmony, as you prefer to avoid conflict. <br><br>This influence brings a tendency toward too much acceptance--of the self and others. You may need prompts and encouragement to question life, or you risk taking things for granted.<br><br>Your vitality is usually good and quite constant. You are not necessarily hard-driving, unless other indications in the chart point to it, but your constitution is generally strong. At any rate, you are not as prone to the ups and downs that often plague those with challenging aspects between the Sun and Moon. This is because even though your life goals and emotional needs differ, they are largely in harmony. <br><br>Short description: Well-rounded and harmony-oriented. He has lots of vitality and more potential than he may realize. He likes public life; he is popular, and others appreciate his company. He is balanced, at ease with himself and usually gets on very well with his parents or guardians. He makes a good guide or mediator.<br><br> 107 Conjunction between the Sun and Mercury<br><br>Because your ego and mind are usually on the same page, you possess abundant mental energy. You are always in a position to think about what you want, and in many ways, this is an interruption of the will. You are highly intelligent with a great drive to communicate with others. You invest a lot of pride in your intellectual capacities. You may not always listen as well as you speak, however, because you're too busy thinking about what to say next! But you are very curious, and although you enjoy expressing yourself, you usually don't dominate conversations completely.<br><br> Regarding studying or learning, you are better off reading the material than listening to a teacher. These traits come from a strong need to actively participate in communications. It is tough for you to listen passively and absorb information. <br><br>Your opinions are usually strong, and you are an independent thinker. You tend to be proud of your ideas and thoughts and might easily get a bruised ego if you are not "heard" or if your opinions are pushed aside, ignored, or criticized. You are expressive and possibly a very animated speaker. You are also very witty; others enjoy your playful and sometimes mischievous sense of humor.<br><br>Key traits: He is verbal, intelligent, observant, and sometimes nervous or wired. <br><br> 138 Trine between the Sun and Saturn<br><br>It's natural for you to accept responsibilities, lead a rather ordered life, and apply caution in your financial and business dealings. This aspect helps stabilize and ground you, giving you a realistic side. You rarely jump to conclusions or take uneducated risks. You have a certain amount of patience and enough self-discipline to slowly but surely achieve what you set out to do. <br><br>Although somewhat undemonstrative, you are generally loyal and responsible to those you care about. You take your time in many of your endeavors and generally use a step-by-step approach to most projects--but you steadily reach your goals. <br><br>This aspect gives you some seriousness. You are naturally trustworthy, and you have little patience for people who don't show respect for others, who take foolish risks, and who lead chaotic lives.<br><br>Key traits: He is grounded, reasonable, level-headed, fundamentally responsible, and deliberate. He benefits from a solid and realistic sense of self and understanding of his capabilities. <br><br><h3>The Moon</h3>The Moon represents the emotional responses, unconscious pre-destination, and the self-image. The Moon represents the emotions, and the Moon sign shows how a person expresses themselves when at home, at ease, and comfortable.<br><br><h5>The Moon is in Scorpio</h5>While others may find security and comfort in material things, Moon in Scorpio people seek out emotional intensity. No matter what, there is something very intense about Lunar Scorpios. They are diggers in the world of emotion--they can see beyond facades and cut right to a person's core. This ability to "see" what isn't apparent to the rest of the world can be intimidating to others or wildly attractive, depending on the audience. <br><br>Their deep-seated need for transformation and rebirth can manifest itself in the lives of Lunar Scorpios in different ways. Most have powerful, emotionally intense lives. Some feel like it is beyond their control -- these natives seem to attract emotional upheaval, and their lives appear to consist of plenty of dramatic ups and downs. <br><br>However, when accepted as an emotional need, rebirth and change don't need to be so dramatic and overwhelming. In some way or the other, Moon in Scorpio natives seek out intense experiences. If their lives are regular, there can be an unconscious need to test their strength and stir up emotional excitement. Self-awareness and acceptance is probably the best way to handle this deep need for emotional drama. <br><br>Doing things halfway or having meaningless relationships simply doesn't fulfill them. Lunar Scorpios want all or nothing. Moon in Scorpio people often have a strong fear of betrayal. They seek commitment and feel the need for a partner to give up something for them. Some will put the people they love through a series of tests, and these are not always conscious. Their apparent suspicion can be trying for the people who love them. <br><br>However, once committed, Moon in Scorpio people can be the most loyal and protective partners around. Even the shy ones have enormous presence. Their lives are emotion-driven, yet many Moon in Scorpio natives spend a lot of time controlling and mastering their emotions. Their intuition is considerable, although it is sometimes self-serving. <br><br>Moon in Scorpio people radiate strength. Even in the absence of experience, they seem to "just know" things. It would be difficult to shock or scare away Lunar Scorpios in the face of emotional honesty and power. Some people instinctively want to lean on them, and other less brave folks run a little scared. <br><br>Lunar Scorpios have exceptional "radar" that allows them to size up a situation--and a person--quickly and expertly. This ability to understand human motivation and nature can be too close for comfort for some and enormously comforting for others. <br><br>Many Lunar Scorpios are intelligent and astute. Those who use their enormous powers for intimacy and honesty are the happiest and make the most interesting and rewarding friends and lovers.<br><br>Short description: <br><br>Courageous, brave, independent, not a fearful nature. He is attracted to sensual erotic partners.<br><br>Potential issues: excesses of pleasures, difficulty letting go.<br><br>-102 Opposition between the Moon and Saturn<br><br>When the Moon is in hard aspect to Saturn in the natal chart, natives need to learn to trust others more. Fear keeps them from fully enjoying personal relationships, and fear is behind the occasional rigidity that they express. When they let themselves receive nurture or care from others, an inner voice cautions them that it might not be sincere, long-lasting, or enough! There can be some reluctance about becoming a parent, but once taken on, these people don't take their responsibility lightly.<br><br>Emotional reticence is the main theme of these aspects. Many people with this aspect had a lot of conditions placed on the love they received in early childhood. They tend to expect the same later in life. With hard Saturn aspects, individuals are often plagued with doubts, not only about the self but about what to expect from life itself. The problem is that expecting difficulties or negative situations creates an aura around them that perpetuates the problem. They must work hard at positive thinking and expecting more from life. Ironically, many people with hard Saturn aspects can be quite sarcastic, skeptical, and rigid in manner. This is essentially a defense mechanism designed to protect themselves from harshness in the world. <br><br>It is extremely likely that they feel neglected because they perceive it in the first place, and later expect it, to be the case. There's a vicious circle going on here that can only be broken when the patterns created by negative conditioning are broken. Adjusting one's perceptions and expectations is the key to breaking out of these negative patterns. Otherwise, natives of hard Moon-Saturn aspects will live life feeling left out--attracting circumstances that perpetuate a feeling of deep unhappiness and dissatisfaction. <br><br>Short description: He has changeable moods, a reserved character, can be stubborn and may lack assurance. His relationship with a guardian may have been difficult or a challenging early family life in some cases.<br><br> -53 Square between the Moon and Uranus<br><br>He may at times suffer from an almost feverish, non-constructive restlessness. He is too susceptible. His life can be full of change or the emotions are often in a state of flux. Also, frequent changes of mind. He is irritable and stubborn at times due to an inner restlessness that is hard to satisfy. He can have difficulty concentrating on a job, although is capable of much if allowed to move from task to task to alleviate extreme boredom with routine. Nervous strain. His friendships may be like his professional and love life - sometimes unstable or erratic. There is a strong need for closeness, but when people get too close, he can get cagey, as he values personal freedom just as much.<br><br><h3>Mercury</h3>Mercury represents communication, Cartesian and logical spirit.<br><br><h5>Mercury is in Capricorn</h5>His mind compartmentalizes impressions, and he appreciates structure and order. The mind learns best when it can see practical uses for information. Resourceful, reflective, deep thinker; a fine and vivacious mind. May undertake lengthy studies or, if circumstances do not allow, will teach himself. A rational person. Can be pessimistic, skeptical, and sarcastic, possessing a very sharp sense of humor. Notices everything.<br><br> 64 Sextile between Mercury - Mars<br><br>He likes discussions, debates, polemic. He has good judgment and can be very determined. He is a worker and has lots of energy. He has a lively intelligence and usually goes to the heart of things. He is enthusiastic, incisive, and energetic in thought and speech.<br><br> 24 Trine between Mercury - Jupiter<br><br>He is intelligent with big ideas: He is tolerant and has a strong sense of justice. He has good judgement, good sense and has his feet on the ground. He has the "gift of gab," fully enjoys literature and learning. He is erudite and will usually be successful socially.<br><br> 50 Conjunction between Mercury - Lilith<br><br>Can be provocative in speech or communications, persuasive, interesting conversationalist, quick to see the flaws of a situation.<br><br><h3>Venus</h3>Venus represents an interest in emotions and values, exchange, and sharing with others.<br><br><h5>Venus is in Sagittarius</h5>When Venus in Sagittarius people are in love, they need to feel they can grow and expand their horizons through their relationship. They want to learn new things, and experience everything together. These are idealistic lovers who want you to appreciate their beliefs, visions, and ideals. They can be a confusing mix of the lighthearted and serious. They are roamers and seekers, and don't commit in their relationships as easily as others. Venus in Sagittarius people turn others on with their big smiles and laughs, their jokes, their grand schemes, their dreams, and their friendly, flirtatious behavior. They pride themselves on their open minds, but you may notice they can be judgmental too. They are threatened by inhibitions on the part of their lover, dullness, and emotional overkill. They are restless, and won't put up with lovers who dwell on any one thing. When the going gets tough in their relationship, they have an overwhelming need to run away. Usually this only means getting out and experiencing something new before they come back, but sometimes it can be for good. They are attracted to people in love with life. You don't need to be refined, polished, or graceful to win their favor. <br><br>Pleasing Venus in Sagittarius involves allowing them lots of room in the relationship to grow. Avoid getting stuck in a rut, and understand their need to move on. Learn to laugh, but take their rants and raves seriously. Avoid criticizing their beliefs, join them in debates, and philosophize along with them. When they feel the need for more experience, join them! Learn to look past their clumsiness with you and your feelings, and avoid cornering them or forcing them to commit.<br><br> -53 Square between Venus - Mars<br><br>Whether it's an infatuation or a full-blown love affair, relationships get you out of bed in the morning. You are passionate and seem to need an active romantic and sexual life to drive you. Often, this area of life is somewhat challenging, especially in youth. As much as you want to be involved in a passionate affair, your timing can be off and/or it's difficult to find a relationship that mirrors your strong desires and expectations. Especially when you are young, there can be a real awkwardness with your social skills--this may or may not be apparent to others.<br><br>You are highly creative and generally are driven to express that creativity. Your passion for romance is often channeled into your creative output. For example, challenges in relationships may be a large part of the drive behind your poetry, music, or other art.<br><br>Love and hate are very much mixed together for you. You are prone to love-hate relationships with others, likely because your passions are such that the old saying "there's a fine line between love and hate" rings especially true for you. Some level of competitiveness, anger, frustration, or angst is present in your romantic relationships. Although you are quick to anger, you are generally just as quick to forget about it. <br><br>Short description: While he is passionate, he likes carnal desires and voluptuousness above all. He may go to excess and can often be unsatisfied. Should probably learn moderation.<br><br> 117 Sextile between Venus - Neptune<br><br>His professional life can be creative or inconstant. He has a taste for the Arts, can be a dreamer, and may be easily influenced and romantic. He is emotional and very sensitive.<br><br>Romantic, creative, gentle, and adaptable, you naturally express the finer qualities of mysterious and dreamy Neptune in your love relationships. Your imagination is rich and your fantasy world well-developed. You are turned off by rudeness and crudeness, and are drawn to beauty in its many forms. You are very giving and generous, but may be a little on the submissive side, or sometimes downright lazy, failing to take the initiative when situations call for it.<br><br><h3>Mars</h3>Mars represents the desire for action and physical energy.<br><br><h5>Mars is in Aquarius</h5>It can be a little difficult to understand exactly what makes a Mars in Aquarius native tick. And that's absolutely fine with them--they enjoy surprising people. The tried-and-true methods of getting things done are far too boring for those born with Mars in this unique and original sign. Mars in Aquarius natives often have a rather original view of the world as well. These natives are generally quite proud of their independence. They are not easily pushed around with Mars in this fixed sign. Because Aquarius is progressive and open-minded when it comes to the world at large, it can be surprising that on a personal level, Mars in Aquarius natives can be quite obstinate. If they feel boxed in, they are quite likely to rebel. If you've discovered a pattern to their ways, they'll make sure they aren't so predictable the next time around. Being seen as "normal" simply won't do!<br><br>With Mars, the planet of energy and drive, in an Air sign, these individuals get off on mental and intellectual pursuits. Aquarius is a somewhat scattered sign, even though it's persevering in the long haul. If there's a method to their madness, it isn't always easy to see. Projects are taken on with a shotgun-style approach with this position of Mars. Mars in Air signs are generally quite clever at getting what they want; in Aquarius, they are particularly adept at getting their way. While this is not an overtly aggressive position of Mars (Aquarius has a manner that is far too detached to come across too forcefully), it is very willful. Combine willfulness with the cleverness of an Air sign, and you have a person who is quite creative about getting what they want--which generally is getting their way! Unlike with Mars in Aries or Leo natives, for example, you won't always know you're being dominated by a Mars in Aquarius native!<br><br>One of the most pleasant characteristics of Mars in Aquarius natives is their willingness to let others be. They place a lot of value in freedom and individuality--theirs and yours. They need space to be themselves and plenty of room to breathe. Generally not the touchy-feely types, these natives often laugh at sentimentality and tradition. In personal relationships, their approach to intimacy is definitely on the detached side, which can be baffling and frustrating to more personal and affectionate personalities. Of all the personal planets in the sign of Aquarius, Mars placed here can show the strongest "reformer" streak. The Aquarian ideal of equality works big time with this position, and the desire to push their agenda on others (usually in creative, rather than aggressive, ways) runs high. Obstinacy and a superiority complex are this position's least desirable traits; openness to new ways of doing things (as long as they're not forced upon them) is where they shine.<br><br> 103 Sextile between Mars - Jupiter<br><br>He has a good sense of organization, he is jovial, frank, and sincere. He is full of dynamism and abundant energy. He loves life, taking all it has to offer. He likes sports and the outdoor life. He is successful professionally and emotionally. He may have many children or projects and ventures.<br><br>He is honest and forthright in his dealings with others, and He tends to trust others readily. He can be a bit careless about spending money, however, and this is probably because he is so eternally optimistic that there will always be plenty around. The possibility of failure does not enter his mind, although success itself is not as important to him as enjoyment and happiness are. Can be pleasantly competitive and good-humored.<br><br> 10 Sextile between Mars - Lilith<br><br>Love affairs are passionate. There is an instinctive understanding of intensity, the dark side of our natures, and passion.<br><br><h3>Jupiter</h3>Jupiter represents expansion and grace.<br><br><h5>Jupiter is in Aries</h5>He attracts the most good fortune when taking the lead, initiating, inspiring, and demonstrating enthusiasm and courage. He believes in the power of positivity, that life is what you make of it. Likes competition, doing things independently. <br><br> 38 Trine between Jupiter - Lilith<br><br>He could meet a partner much wealthier than himself. Good sexual understanding.<br><br><h3>Saturn</h3>Saturn represents contraction and effort.<br><br><h5>Saturn is in Taurus</h5>He doesn't like to see greed or waste in others. Must not shun materialism and possessiveness completely, and learn to build up a sense of being "deserving" of some pleasures in life.<br><br> -28 Square between Saturn - Uranus<br><br>He does not like routine, whether at work or in his emotional life. He fights to keep his independence, his freedom of action. He would gladly re-make the world.<br><br><h3>Uranus</h3>Uranus represents individual liberty, egoistic liberty.<br><br><h5>Uranus in Aquarius</h5>May get over-excited at the start of a task that interests him. At times, his debonair personality can give others a banal impression.<br><br> 40 Sextile between Uranus - Pluto<br><br>He fights to improve his daily life, he is persevering.<br><br><h3>Neptune</h3>Neptune represents transcendental liberty, non-egoistic liberty.<br><br><h5>Neptune is in Aquarius</h5>Generosity, especially enjoying resolving problems in order to satisfy everyone.<br><br><h3>Pluto</h3>Pluto represents transformations, mutations, and elimination. <br><br><h5>Pluto is in Sagittarius</h5>Great aspirations: sexuality and love are idealized.<br><br><h3>Lilith</h3>Black Moon Lilith represents our darker, deeper natures that may be repressed or buried. <br><br><h5>Lilith in Sagittarius</h5>He may have felt uncomfortable or even ashamed for his curiosity, questions, restlessness, the need to challenge and question life/facts/beliefs, or the need to get away, expand, and seek meaning. He may feel uncomfortable around people who are expressing these Sagittarian traits, not quite trusting them! Learning to accept and even embrace these traits without apology can be empowering. It can also help end a cycle of going to extremes with these traits.<br><br><h3>North Node-South Node</h3>The South Node represents our overdeveloped character traits. We are talented here but if we overdo this area of life or hold onto these traits to feel secure, we may stagnate. The North Node points to the qualities that we need to work on and develop to achieve inner balance and fulfillment.<br><br><h5>True North Node in Leo</h5>He can be a friend to many but may stumble a little when things get too personal. His path is to embrace his individuality and to allow himself to be the center of attention or to strike out on a unique creative path. He is learning to be more personal and less intellectual when expressing his feelings. Qualities to develop: Intimacy, sharing, self-expression.<br><br><h3>The Houses </h3><em>House I</em> is the area of self identity. The ascendant is a symbol of how one acts in life. It is the image of the personality as seen by others, and the attitude that one has towards life.<br><br>House II - the second house - is the area of material security and values. It rules money and personal finances, sense of self-worth and basic values, personal possessions.<br><br>House III - the third house - is the area of social and intellectual learning.<br><br>House IV - the fourth house - is the area of home, family, roots, and deep emotions/sense of self-worth.<br><br>House V - the fifth house - is the area of creative self-expression, romance, entertainment, children, and gambling.<br><br>House VI - the sixth house - is the area of learning by material transaction.<br><br>House VII - the seventh house - is the area of one-to-one relationships such as marriage and partnership, and of social and intellectual action.<br><br>House VIII - the eighth house - is the area of emotional security and of security of the soul.<br><br>House IX - the ninth house - is the area of learning that shapes the identity.<br><br>House X - the tenth house - is the area of material action. The Midheaven represents the work one will do in one's life, the place one will take in the world of society. It becomes more important as one grows older.<br><br>House XI - the eleventh house - is the area of search for social and intellectual security.<br><br>House XII - the twelfth house - is the area of education and of emotion. This is where we meet our karma, deal with endings, and sometimes where we bury things.<br><br> <BR>
